### It's all about You and Your Kitchen!

Our team of painters are experts at painting kitchens. Whether you have an old ugly kitchen or are in the design phase of a brand new kitchen, iPaint can transform your kitchen into a stylish oasis you're sure to love! Oh, did I mention...make your neighbors jealous too!

**Old and New Cabinets:**

* First off... your Kitchen Cabinetry is not a bedroom wall. Do you want an Average Joe Painter to paint your cabinets who doesn't have a solid picture portfolio, insurance, and gave you the lowest Bid?  Of course not... you want a reasonably priced professional painter who knows how to paint kitchens like a craftsman and takes pride in his work. Hire a Pro and your Kitchen will thank you!
* On **Old Cabinets** we figure out what the existing finish is, in most cases it will be either oil, lacquer, or latex. On **New Cabinets** we determine the wood species and move to the next step.
* Properly clean and sand the cabinet surfaces with our dust extraction Festool sanders using Granat sand paper. This ensures a smooth finish that will accept paint properly.
* Apply a sealcoat also known as a primer so the cabinets will accept a finish coat. Shellac, Insl-x Stix bonding primer, and Lacquer undercoater are superior to all other primers and sealers.
* Apply a finish coat. We thoroughly test and use products that have the best adhesion, resistance to abuse, and moisture. In some cases indoor health is a concern so we would suggest a low or Zero VOC coating that meets our qualifications.

**Where do we paint your cabinets?** We paint most all Kitchen cabinets on site and in some situations where space is limited, we take the cabinet doors and drawers to the shop for finishing. Sometimes we even build a spray-booth in the garage with the permission of the customer.

**Price** varies so greatly that we would need to come look at your Kitchen cabinets before giving a firm estimate. Items like wood wine racks, blank paneling, intricate moulding, wood vent-hoods, islands, and many other similar items will add to the below pricing. However, I can give you a realistic **ballpark price** for quality work thats backed by experienced painters, referrals, insurance verification in your name, and a signed contract stating all the specifics.

**Pricing**

* For simple 1 solid color paint jobs... add up your cabinet doors and drawer opening, then times by $65
* For multi solid color paint jobs... add up your cabinet doors and drawer opening, then times by $85
* For antiqued, distressed, or glazed paint jobs... add up your cabinet doors and drawer opening, then times by $100-150 (price increases depending on the look you want, and level of distressing)
